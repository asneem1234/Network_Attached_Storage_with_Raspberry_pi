## Presentation Tips

1. **Practice the demo thoroughly** before presenting
2. Have a **backup plan** in case of technical issues
3. Prepare for common questions about:
   - Security considerations
   - Performance limitations
   - Scalability options
   - Enterprise applications
4. Consider recording a video of the working system as backup
5. Prepare handouts with technical specifications
