## Design Guidelines

- Use a consistent, professional color scheme
- Limit text on slides (use bullet points)
- Include relevant diagrams and screenshots
- Use high-quality images of the hardware
- Create simple charts for cost comparisons
- Include brief speaker notes for each slide

## Presentation Tips

1. **Practice the demo thoroughly** before presenting
2. Have a **backup plan** in case of technical issues
3. Prepare for common questions about:
   - Security considerations
   - Performance limitations
   - Scalability options
   - Enterprise applications
4. Consider recording a video of the working system as backup
5. Prepare handouts with technical specifications

## Demo Checklist

- [ ] Test network connectivity before presentation
- [ ] Prepare all sample files and data in advance
- [ ] Verify all user accounts and permissions
- [ ] Test all client devices and connections
- [ ] Prepare backup slides in case of demo issues
- [ ] Have terminal commands ready in a text file
- [ ] Check battery levels on all devices
