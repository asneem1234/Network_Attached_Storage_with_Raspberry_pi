## Review Preparation Checklist

### For All Reviews
- Schedule review meeting 2 weeks in advance
- Distribute agenda and materials 3 days before meeting
- Prepare slide deck and demonstration environment
- Conduct dry run 1 day before review
- Assign specific speaking roles to team members
- Prepare answers to anticipated questions

### For Final Review
- Ensure all features are thoroughly tested
- Prepare backup demonstration plan in case of technical issues
- Create handouts with key technical specifications
- Record video demonstration as backup
- Prepare project poster highlighting key achievements
